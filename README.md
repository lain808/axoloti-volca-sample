# axoloti-volca-sample
Axoloti patch to fully control Korg Volca Sample.
With this patch you can control the volca sample via only one MIDI channel. 
Normally you need 10 channels. The patch makes it easier to control the Volca with external sequencers. 

I'm looking forward to your suggestions or ideas for further features. It's one of my first patches, so it's probably a bit chaotic.
